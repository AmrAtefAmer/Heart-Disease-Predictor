# Heart-Disease-Predictor
In this project I used machine learning algorithm to predict if person may have heart disease or not and build a simple website with flask that uses a classification model. I did analysis with python(pandas library) and sql I used python because it is popular language in machine learning world

# Contents
  - Heart Disease Predictor.ipynb
  - eda_sql.ipynb this file contains some analysis with sql
  - app.py
  - template folder that have html pages
  - static folder that have logo and background images
  - models that have scaler and classifier algorithm
  - procfile that heroku needs
  - requirements.txt that have libraries heroku needs to install

# Software Requirements
  - Jupyter notebook (editor)
  - visual studio code (editor) or any python editor
  - heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS)
  - sqlite database
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - imblearn
  - flask
  - Flask-WTF -WTForms -joblib

# How to use project
  - First u need to install anaconda, visual studio code and all libraries above 
  - then start with running ipynb file then run py file 
  - install git 
  - go to heroku website and follow instructions
